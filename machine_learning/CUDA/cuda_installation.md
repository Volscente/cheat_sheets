# Components
- **NVIDIA GPU Driver** - It allows the Operating System to communicate with the NVIDIA GPU
- **CUDA Toolkit** - It is a Development environment used to build, debug and optimize the performance of applications on NVIDIA GPUs
- **CUDA Deep Neural Network** - It is a GPU-accelerated library for Deep Neural Networks that provides highly optimized implementations for primitive functions (e.g., forward and backward convolution, pooling, etc.)
