# Introduction
## Definition
Recommendation system is an umbrella term that collects every piece of the system that produces recommendations. Including the model, the data pipeline, the data collection and the data streaming ingestion.

Sometimes, we think about recommendation only in the sense of items recommended to a user. However, especially in marketing, the other way around is also true: recommending potential interested users to a product.

## Types
### Content-based
This recommender uses the information about the product in order to recommend it to the user. For example, recommending the most rated film among a category that a specific user likes. This recommendation is based on the product information (most rated) and then it is personalised on the specific user preferences (category that they like)
