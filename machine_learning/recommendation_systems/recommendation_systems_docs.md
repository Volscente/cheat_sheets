## Definition
Recommendation system is an umbrella term that collects every piece of the system that produces recommendations. Including the model, the data pipeline, the data collection and the data streaming ingestion.

Sometimes, we think about recommendation only in the sense of items recommended to a user. However, especially in marketing, the other way around is also true: recommending potential interested users to a product.
