# General
## MLOps Definition
MLOps, short for Machine Learning Operations, is a set of practices that aims to integrate machine learning (ML) systems into the broader context of software development and operations. MLOps seeks to streamline and automate the end-to-end ML lifecycle, ensuring the efficient development, deployment, monitoring, and maintenance of ML models.

## Roles
- **Data Analyst** - Queries and analyse
- **Data Engineer** - Retrieve and clean data
- **Data Scientist** - Train models
- **Machine Learning Developer** - Create intelligent apps
- **Machine Learning Engineer** - Deploy models

## Steps
1. Data Extraction
2. Data Analysis
3. Data Preparation
4. Model Training
5. Model Evaluation
6. Model Validation
7. Model Serving
8. Model Monitoring

## Components
### Feature Store
It is a central storage solution for features that provides the following capabilities:
- Efficient sharing of features
- Reduced duplicate efforts
- Centralized management and serving of features
- Search and filter capabilities
- Managed solution for online serving at scale
- Mitigate training-serving skew
- Detect drift

# Levels
## Definition
Depending on the level of automation of the MLOps steps, there are different levels of MLOps.

## Level 0
Every step is performed manually.

## Level 1
It auitomates the training phase.

## Level 2
It automates the training, validation and deployment.
