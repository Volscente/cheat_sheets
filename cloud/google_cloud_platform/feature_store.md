# Introduction
## Definition
It offers a centralized repository for organizing, storing and serving ML features. 
Since it is a shared repository, it can be re-used across different use cases.
## Benefits
- Features are hard to share and reuse
- Hard to reliably serving them in production with low latency
- Inadvertent skew in feature values between training and serving (training data are different from the ones 
that are then used in production)
