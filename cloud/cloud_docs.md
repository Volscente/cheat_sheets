# Introduction
## History
There are several phases that, ultimately, lead to the advent of cloud computing:
1. **Time Sharing** - 1960 IBM has a giant mainframe computer. People go there and use it when theyu want
2. **Virtualisation** - Very populare between the 1990 and 2000. It creates a virtual machine on top of an hardware resource. So many poeple can use that hardware resource at the same time, through different virtual machines.
3. **Serverless** - A cloud provider allocates machine resources and compute capabilities on demand and takes care of the server hardware on behalf of the customer

## Characteristics
NIST definition of key features of the Cloud:
1. **On-Demand Self Service** - Users can provision computing capabilities automatically, without requiring human interaction
2. **Broad Network Access** - Cloud features are available over the network through standard mechanisms
3. **Resource Pooling** - Cloud provider's computing resources are pooled together to service multiple consumers and consumers are independent of the geographical location of such computing resources
4. **Rapid Elasticity** - Computing resources can be elastically provisioned or released commensurate with demand (Scalability)
5. **Measured Service** - Resource usage can be monitored and reported to the consumer
