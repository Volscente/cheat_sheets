# Introduction
## Characteristics
NIST definition of key features of the Cloud:
- **On-Demand Self Service** - Users can provision computing capabilities automatically, without requiring human interaction
- **Broad Network Access** - Cloud features are available over the network through standard mechanisms
- **Resource Pooling** - Cloud provider's computing resources are pooled together to service multiple consumers and consumers are independent of the geographical location of such computing resources
- **Rapid Elasticity** - Computing resources can be elastically provisioned or released commensurate with demand (Scalability)
- **Measured Service** - Resource usage can be monitored and reported to the consumer
