# Data Management
## Data Characteristics (The 3 Vs)
- Variety - How different are data
- Voracity - How fast data should be ingested
- Volume - How much data
## Data Area Hierarchy
1. **Data Collection** - Extract data from several sources in different formats
2. **Data Wrangling** - Improve the data quality (clean data, handle missing values, address inconsistent data, etc.)
3. **Data Integration** - Load data into a sink destination
4. **BI and Analytics**
5. **Machine Learning**
The first three steps can be associated to the **ETL Process** (Extract, Transform and Load)
