# Introduction

## Definition
Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. 
It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you. 
Poetry offers a lockfile to ensure repeatable installs, and can build your project for distribution.
